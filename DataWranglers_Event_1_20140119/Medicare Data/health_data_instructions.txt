Challenge #1: Relating hospital fees to performance

> How do fees for different treatments relate to performance? (Hopefully, better hospitals charge more, but perhaps some treatments are more indicative of overall performance than others.) 

> Identify the best and worst hospitals in terms of value (low fees and high performance) controlling for the health of the population.

> What factors identify poor value hospitals? 

Our data includes (1) the performance of 3,000+ U.S. hospitals in terms of mortality and patient readmission for the treatment of a variety of conditions (heart attacks, pneumonia, etc.) (2) hospital fees and insurance payments by Medicare.
