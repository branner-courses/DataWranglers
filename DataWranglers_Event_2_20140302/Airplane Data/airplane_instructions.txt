The Airplane Flight Challenge

For this study, I have uploaded data on airplane flights provided by the Bureau of Transportation.  This is an extraordinary data set, and there are a lot of questions you can explore.

In the Airplane Data folder, you will find three files:

airplane_2008.csv this is the main data set, a 689 MB file 
carriers.csv provides a key to the codes for the carriers in the main file
plane_data.csv provides a key to the codes for the airplane identifiers in the main file

This airplane flight data set is also available here (for 1987 through 2008): http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html

You will can find additional information about the data set here:

Challenges

1) Study flight delays by day of week and season (spring, summer, winter, fall, holidays). What is the worst time to fly? (easy)

2) Are planes by a particular manufacturer - Boeing, Airbus, etc. - more likely to be delayed? Can you figure out why? (easy)

2) Cluster airplane carriers characteristics in the data set. Now do a model of flight delays using these groups of carriers as a predictor. Also, among the traditional commercial airline carriers, who are the best performers? (moderate)

To do this analysis properly, you might want to control for the airports and flight paths the carriers use. This is a difficult problem!

3) Combine flight data with weather data. Develop a model of how weather influences flight delays. Are certain carriers better at managing bad weather? (difficult)

Extra credit: Study the influence of weather on flights using all of the data from 1987 through 2008. Is the affect of weather on delays getting better or worse. This is a serious Big Data challenge.
