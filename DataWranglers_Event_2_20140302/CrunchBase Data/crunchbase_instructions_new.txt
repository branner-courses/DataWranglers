CrunchBase Data Challenge

This study is based on data sources provided by CrunchBase. Similar to the airplane data set, the CrunchBase data provides an extraordinary number of opportunities to important questions.

In the CrunchBase Data Folder, you will find two files aside from these instructions.

"acquisitions_full.csv" contains data about companies acquired for over $5m

"founders_with_birthdate.json" is a smaller file with data about the founders of company listed in the larger acquisitions_full.csv data set. This file only contains data on the subset of founders whose birthdays were provided by CrunchBase.

1) Does proximity increase the amount of acquisitions? Create an input variable for proximity between the acquirer and acquired company? (moderate)

2) What are the patterns in the size of acquisitions in the past year? What are the patterns in the quantities of acquisitions? For example: very small (>$50m), small ($75m - $150m), medium ($150 - $450m), large ($450m - $1b), and very large. (easy)

3) How do entrepreneurs' educational backgrounds affect their success? (difficult)
